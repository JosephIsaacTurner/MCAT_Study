## Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems

### General Chemistry
**Surface Tension**
- Increases with intermolecular forces, especially hydrogen bonding; decreases with temperature.
**Specific Heat**
- Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of a substance by 1 degree Celsius.
**Heat Capacity**
- Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an entire substance by 1 degree Celsius.
**Stabilization of Conjugate Bases**
- Electron withdrawing groups stabilize conjugate bases, making acid stronger
- Larger atoms stabilize conjugate bases, making acid stronger (that's why HF is weak and HI is strong)
- Resonance stabilizes conjugate bases, making acids stronger

### Organic Chemistry

**Vicinal Diols**
- Two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons
- Commonly used to cleave alkanes/alkenes through oxidative cleavage
- Also called glycols, and relevant to carbohydrate chemistry

**Diastereomers**
- Differ at some, but not all, chiral centers
- One type is epimers, which differ at only one chiral center
- Have different physical properties, including melting point, boiling point, and solubility

### Physics
**Laminar Flow**
- Characeterized by parallel flow lines

**Electromagnetic Spectrum**
- Visible is between 400 and 700 nm (nm = 10^-9)
    - 700 is red, 400 is violet
- High frequency in Hz means high energy and short wavelengths
    - UV, X-rays, Gamma Rays
- Low frequency in Hz means low energy and long wavelengths
    - Infrared, Microwaves, Radio Waves
