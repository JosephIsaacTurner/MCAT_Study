## Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems

- RBCs don't have membrane-bound organelles and rely on glycolysis for ATP production

### Physiology

**Respiratory Quotient (RQ)**: Ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed. RQ = 1 for carbohydrates, 0.7 for fats, and 0.8 for proteins. Higher RQ means more CO2 is produced relative to O2 consumes, and implies more carbohydrates used for energy.
