## Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior

### Identity
**Freud**
- Libido: sexual energy, present from birth
- Oral stage (0-1): pleasure form mouth. Fixation leads to dependency
- Anal stage (1-3): pleasure from bowel movements. Fixation leads to anal retentiveness or expulsiveness (neatness or messiness)
- Phallic stage or Oedipal stage (3-6): pleasure from genitals, sublimation of libido. Oedipus complex means male child wants mother and sees father as rival
- Latency stage (6-12): libido is dormant
- Genital stage (12+): libido is awakened, and sexual pleasure is sought

**Erikson**
- Failure to positively resolve a stage will lead to negative outcomes, but can be learned later
- Trust vs. misrust (0-1): To trust caregivers
- Autonomy vs shame and doubt (1-3): To be independent (negative outcome: doubt, external locus of control)
- Initiative vs guilt (3-6): Learning decisions, consequences, and accomplishment (negative outcome: guilt, fear of punishment)
- Industry vs inferiority (6-12): Learning to be competent (negative outcome: inferiority, low self-esteem)
- Identity vs role confusion (12-20): To find oneself in society, fidelity (negative outcome: confusion, amorphous personality)
- Intimacy vs isolation (20-40): To form relationships (negative outcome: isolation, loneliness)
- Generativity vs stagnation (40-65): To contribute to society (negative outcome: stagnation, self-absorption)
- Integrity vs despair (65+): To accept life as it is, leading to wisdom (negative outcome: despair, regret)

**Kohlberg**
- Preconventional morality (0-9): Obedience, self-interest
- Conventional morality (9-20): Conformity, law and order
- Postconventional morality (20+, if at all): Social contract, universal human ethics

**Vygotsky**
- Zone of proximal development: Difference between what a child can do alone and what a child can do with help. Learning occurs in this zone

**Bandura**
- Social learning theory: People learn from observing others, including identification with role models

**Looking-glass self**: Self-concept is based on how we think others perceive us

**Reference group**: Group that provides a standard of comparison for self-evaluation.

### Personality

**Freud**
- Id: Pleasure principle, unconscious. Primary process is to seek immediate gratification
- Ego: Reality principle, conscious. Secondary process is to delay gratification
- Superego: Idealist principle, unconscious. Conscience (what one should not do) and ego-ideal (what one should be)
- Preconscious: Thoughts not in awareness
- Unconscious: Thoughts not accessible to awareness (repressed)
- Defense mechanisms: Ego's way of reducing anxiety by distorting reality
    - Repression: Unconscious but intentional forgetting, hiding from awareness
    - Regression: Reverting to an earlier stage of development
    - Reaction formation: Converting an unwanted thought into its opposite
    - Projection: Attributing unwanted thoughts to others
        - Rohrschach inkblot test, thematic apperception test
    - Rationalization: Justifying behavior by substituting acceptable reasons for real reasons
    - Displacement: Redirecting feelings to a less threatening object
    - Sublimation: Redirecting unacceptable urges to more socially acceptable behavior

**Jung**
