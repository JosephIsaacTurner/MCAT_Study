# Missed MCAT Practice Questions

## Chemistry

### 1
**Q:** Which of the following best expresses the algebraic relationship between molar solubility, `x`, of `Ca_3(PO_4)_2`, and its solubility product constant `K_{sp}`?

**A:** `108x^5`

Explanation: The algebraic relationship is derived from the dissolution equation of `Ca_3(PO_4)_2` and applying the equilibrium constant expression to find `K_{sp}`.

### 2
**Q:** What is the correct electronic configuration for Cu?

**A:** You would expect 3d9, but its actually `1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1 3d10`

Explanation: Copper is an exception to the Aufbau principle, because completely filled and half-filled subshells are more stable than partially filled subshells. So, take one from the 4s orbital, leaving 4s subshell half-filled, and add it to the 3d orbital, leaving 3d subshell completely filled.

### 3
**Q:** 25 g of O2(g) at room temperature is added to a calorimeter containing 100 mL of water at the same temperature. Which of the following graphs best describes the temperature change in the calorimeter as a function of time? (Note: Heat of solution O2 < 0)

**A:** First temperature increases, then stabilizes (slight decrease from peak)

Explanation: Heat of solution is negative, so the dissolution of O2 in water is exothermic (release of heat). This means temperature will go up, but as all the O2 is dissolved, heat will be released at a slower rate, so temperature will stabilize as the system reaches thermal equilibrium with surroundings.

### Question 4

**Q:** Which is the total number of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms present in DNFB (contains benzene ring)
<img src="images/dnfb.png" width="150">

**A:** 6

Explanation: Conjugated system in benzene ring means all carbons are sp2-hybridized. I think I didn't have time to read this question properly. THe nitrogens are also sp2-hybridized. 

## Organic Chemistry

### 1
**Q:** A Boc-protected amino acid, shown above, is formed by the reaction of an amino acid with Boc anhydride under basic conditions. Which structure represents Boc anhydride?

**A:** ![Boc Anhydride](images/boc_anhydride.png)

Explanation: Boc anhydride is used to protect the amine group of amino acids during peptide synthesis, making it a crucial reagent in biochemistry.

### 2
**Q:** An alternative to Boc is 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). How will the rate of peptide synthesis be affected if Fmoc is used instead of Boc as the protecting group for SPPS (solid-phase peptide synthesis)?

**A:** In general, Fmoc is easier to work with and more efficient than Boc. However, Fmoc is more hydrophobic and leads to more aggregation of hydrophobic peptides, impeding synthesis. 

Explanation: Fmoc is deprotected under mild, basic conditions, making it easier to work with than Boc, which requires harsher acidic conditions for deprotection. However, Fmoc is more hydrophobic and can lead to aggregation of hydrophobic peptides, which can impede synthesis.

### 3
**Q:** A solution containing both Compount 1 (four hydrogen bonds to amines, some conjugation) and compound 2 (two hydrogen bonds, extensively conjugated) separates into two phases. WHich of the following statements best describes the expected composition of the phases?

**A:** Compound 2 will be primarily found in the organic layer due to extensive conjugation

Explanation: Conjugation delocalizes electrons, making Compound 2 overall nonpolar and soluble in organic solvents.

## Enzymes

### 1
**Q:** Which of the following can be concluded from Figure 1?

**A:** hxtE has the same Vmax as WT, but higher Km; Meaning that gluoce uptake is more greatly affected by the absence of HxtE at low glucose concentrations than it is at high glucose concentrations. Lower affinity but same maximum velocity.

Explanation: The x-intercept is -1/Km, and the y-intercept is 1/Vmax. The closer to the origin, the higher the Km/Vmax; high Vmax is good, high Km is bad (low affinity).

## Physics

### Question 1
**Q:** Which of the following is NOT a true statement about the central electrode within the Geiger-Muller tube when the Geiger counter is producing clicks?

**A:** It directly interacts with incoming radiation.

Explanation: The central electrode is actually positive charged, attracting electrons ionized from the gas by incoming radiation, and repelling the cationic gas ions.

### Question 2
**Q:** Assume that the central electrode in the Geiger-Muller tube and the tube's casing generate a uniform electrif field. If the distance between the central electrode and the casing is two centimeters, what is the magnitude of the electric field between them? Note that V = 360.

**A:** 18 kN/C.

Explanation: `E = V/d = 360 V / 0.02 m = 18 kN/C`

### Question 3
**Q:** A 14C atom undergoes beta-minus decay. What is the resulting atom?

**A:** 14 N

Explanation: Beta-minus decay is the conversion of a neutron to a proton, emitting an electron (and an antineutrino). So, 14C becomes 14N (gain of a proton). The general trend is that the mass number stays the same, but the atomic number increases by 1.

### Question 4
**Q:** When the current through a coil of copper wire increases, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil:

**A:** Increases

Explanation: The magnetic field at the center of a coil is directly proportional to the current through the coil. We're not talking about magnetic field inside the wire, but flux density at the center of the coil. It's the change in current that induces a magnetic field.
