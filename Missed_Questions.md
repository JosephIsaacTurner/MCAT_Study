# Missed MCAT Practice Questions

## Chemistry

### 1
**Q:** Which of the following best expresses the algebraic relationship between molar solubility, `x`, of `Ca3(PO_4)_2`, and its solubility product constant `K_{sp}`?

**A:** `108x^5`

Explanation: The algebraic relationship is derived from the dissolution equation of `Ca_3(PO_4)_2` and applying the equilibrium constant expression to find `K_{sp}`.

### 2
**Q:** What is the correct electronic configuration for Cu?

**A:** You would expect 3d9, but its actually `1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1 3d10`

Explanation: Copper is an exception to the Aufbau principle, because completely filled and half-filled subshells are more stable than partially filled subshells. So, take one from the 4s orbital, leaving 4s subshell half-filled, and add it to the 3d orbital, leaving 3d subshell completely filled.

### 3
**Q:** 25 g of O2(g) at room temperature is added to a calorimeter containing 100 mL of water at the same temperature. Which of the following graphs best describes the temperature change in the calorimeter as a function of time? (Note: Heat of solution O2 < 0)

**A:** First temperature increases, then stabilizes (slight decrease from peak)

Explanation: Heat of solution is negative, so the dissolution of O2 in water is exothermic (release of heat). This means temperature will go up, but as all the O2 is dissolved, heat will be released at a slower rate, so temperature will stabilize as the system reaches thermal equilibrium with surroundings.

### Question 4

**Q:** Which is the total number of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms present in DNFB (contains benzene ring)
<img src="images/dnfb.png" width="150">

**A:** 6

Explanation: Conjugated system in benzene ring means all carbons are sp2-hybridized. I think I didn't have time to read this question properly. THe nitrogens are also sp2-hybridized. 

### Question 5

**Q:** What is the equilibrium constant expression for `3AL(s) + 3NH4CLO4(s) -> AL2O3(s) + ALCL3(s) + 3NO(g) + 6H2O(g)`?

**A:** [NO]^3 * [H2O]^6

Explanation: Only gases or aqueous solutions are included in the equilibrium constant expression. Solids and liquids are not included.

### Question 6

**Q:** Is the reaction `6CO2 + 6H2O + light -> C6H12O6 + 6O2` spontaneous, and does it increase/decrease entropy? `ΔG = +686 kcal/mol`. 

**A:** The reaction is nonspontaneous and decreases entropy. It is nonspontaneous because ΔG is positive, and it decreases entropy because the products are more ordered than the reactants (solid glucose vs gaseous CO2, and fewer moles). 

### Question 7

**Q:** If the rate constant is in the units of s^-1, what is the order of the reaction?

**A:** First order; Rate is always in units of M/s, so if S^-1 is the rate constant, the order is 1 to make the units match. Similarly, if 

### Question 8

**Q:** When phosphoric acid is titrated with a strong base, which of the following is the predominant compound present at the third equivalence point?

**A:** Dihydrogen phosphate

### Question 9

**Q:** A molecule that picks up a proton is an:

**A:**Both a Bronsted-Lowry base and a Lewis base, but not an Arrhenius base.

### Question 10

**Q:** Atomic oxygen is extremely reactive and not found in any significant quality on Earth's surface, because:

**A:** It is a free radical (though it has six valence electrons, two are unpaired because of Hund's rule)

### Question 11

**Q:** In Potassium Nitrate, what is the oxidation state of nitrogen? (KNO3)

**A:** +5, because K+ is +1 and O is always -2 unless it's in a peroxide (-1), so N must be +5 for it to be a neutral compound. 

### Question 12

**Q:** What hapepns if only part of a reaction mixture is transferred to a volumetric flask and optical rotation is measured?

**A:** The observed rotation would decreased but specific rotation would remain the same. This is because specific rotation is standardized by dividing observed rotation by the concentration and path length.Concentration is in g/100mL, and path length is in decimeters, which is kind of unusual.

### Question 13

**Q:** The pKa of a weak acid in solution is 5.4. If the ratio of concentration of the weak acid to its conjugate base is 10:1, what is the pH of the solution?

**A:** 4.4.

### Question 14

**Q:** Which of the following is correctly arranged in order of increasing melting point?

**A:** Urea < Glucose < Lactose, (in order of molecular size essentially)

### Question 15

**Q:** Standard enthalpy of formation liquid water is -286 KJ/mol. Standard enthalpy of vaporization of liquid water is 44 kJ/mol. What is the standard enthalpy of formation of water vapor?

**A:** -242 kJ/mol (ΔHfvapor = ΔHfliquid + ΔHvap)

### Question 16

**Q:** Where is the equivalence point on a titration curve? What does it tell you about an acid?

**A:** Visually, it is the inflection point where the curve is steepest, where its tangent is vertical. If the equivalence point is greater than ph=7, the acid is a weak acid.

### Question 17

**Q:** If H2CO3 has pKa of 6.35, and HCO3- has a pKa of 10.33, do you want a higher proportion of H2CO3 or HCO3- to buffer a solution fo pH of 9.5?

**A:** HCO3-, because it is closer to the desired pH. Equal concentrations of acid/conjugate base mean pH = pKa (half equivalance point), so shifting the equilibrium further to right requires more conjugate base.

### Question 18

**Q:** In their pure liquid states, which would exhibit greater surface tension: Glycerol or phosphatidic acid?

**A:** Glycerol, because it is capable of hydrogen bonding with itself, while pure phosphatidic acid is not, even though it is charged (h-bonds are probably more important anyway)

### Question 19
**Q:** A student performs a titration with a base as the titrant and an acid as the analyte. He finds taht the pH at the equivalence point is 8.3, and concludes that he was adding naOH to HF. Which of the following observations made during the titration does NOT support his conclusion?
**A:** To reach the equivalent point, 10 mL of base (0.5 M) was added to 5 mL of acid (.25 M). This is too much base to be the equivalence point for that amount of acid.

## Organic Chemistry

### 1
**Q:** A Boc-protected amino acid, shown above, is formed by the reaction of an amino acid with Boc anhydride under basic conditions. Which structure represents Boc anhydride?

**A:** ![Boc Anhydride](images/boc_anhydride.png)

Explanation: Boc anhydride is used to protect the amine group of amino acids during peptide synthesis, making it a crucial reagent in biochemistry.

### 2
**Q:** An alternative to Boc is 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). How will the rate of peptide synthesis be affected if Fmoc is used instead of Boc as the protecting group for SPPS (solid-phase peptide synthesis)?

**A:** In general, Fmoc is easier to work with and more efficient than Boc. However, Fmoc is more hydrophobic and leads to more aggregation of hydrophobic peptides, impeding synthesis. 

Explanation: Fmoc is deprotected under mild, basic conditions, making it easier to work with than Boc, which requires harsher acidic conditions for deprotection. However, Fmoc is more hydrophobic and can lead to aggregation of hydrophobic peptides, which can impede synthesis.

### 3
**Q:** A solution containing both Compount 1 (four hydrogen bonds to amines, some conjugation) and compound 2 (two hydrogen bonds, extensively conjugated) separates into two phases. WHich of the following statements best describes the expected composition of the phases?

**A:** Compound 2 will be primarily found in the organic layer due to extensive conjugation

Explanation: Conjugation delocalizes electrons, making Compound 2 overall nonpolar and soluble in organic solvents.

### 4
**Q:** TdT facilitates the addition of nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand. What typ of reaction is it likely to catalyze?

**A:** Nucleophilic substitution (the 3' OH group of the DNA strand is a nucleophile, and attacks the phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide, displacing the pyrophosphate group)

### 5
**Q:** When an acyl halide reacts with a primary alcohol, which of the following will form?

**A:** An ester and a hydrogen halide.

### 6

### Question 3
**Q:** A 14C atom undergoes beta-minus decay. What is the resulting atom?

**A:** 14 N

Explanation: Beta-minus decay is the conversion of a neutron to a proton, emitting an electron (and an antineutrino). So, 14C becomes 14N (gain of a proton). The general trend is that the mass number stays the same, but the atomic number increases by 1.

### Question 4
**Q:** When the current through a coil of copper wire increases, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil:

**A:** Increases

Explanation: The magnetic field at the center of a coil is directly proportional to the current through the coil.

Equation to know: `B = (mu_0 * n * I) / (2 * r)`

### Question 5
**Q:** Which of the following best explains why the orbit of the ISS changes over time if left unattended?

**A:** Kinetic energy is lost as heat due to atmospheric drag (transferred to the atmosphere), causing the orbit to decay. 

Explanation: Gravity will never stop pulling the ISS towards the earth, but its velocity keeps the acceleration due to gravity orthogonal to the velocity vector, so it keeps missing the earth and no work is done. However, atmospheric drag will slow it down, causing it to lose kinetic energy and spiral towards the earth.

### Question 6
**Q:** While working with a device connected through a 3600 ohm resistor to the main DC power supply (160 V), an ISS crewmember simultaneously touches the ship's hull and an exposed wire positioned between the resistor and the device.
